# Docs Working Group Guide Book

This Guide Book aims to provide help for contributors by offering advice and best practices that they can use during their work. It also aims to guide decisions and operations of the Docs Working Group as a whole.

## Best Practices

- Prefer plain language
    - Improves accessibility to a wide range of people with different backgrounds
    - Where jargon is used, define it in-document or link out to a glossary or other source
- Use deep page heirarchies
    - They provide detail without overwhelming readers (with length and complexity)
    - Think Wikipedia page structure
    - Break up long documents into separate parts where feasible, and structure complex information into separate, focused topics where feasible
- Prefer interlinking between pages within a subproject or topic, and to other projects
    - The Project Jupyter (meta) docs pages are a great target for interlinking because they are relevant to many subprojects
    - Breaking up a topic into small focused documents and interlinking them can provide the same information in an easier to read form
- Consider how your content fits into the diataxis docs framework before you start, to ensure your content is focused toward the right purpose
- Key Docs pages should be checked before release, so that essential information is not broken

## Key Observations

These points were brought up during early Docs Working Group discussions. Some common challenges we need to be aware of while doing our work:

- Users often express that it's challenging to get a unified view of "what is Jupyter" and how the components work together.
    - We should work to remedy this and provide more explanation and context in appropriate places.
- Jupyter's modular approach (from The Big Split) can make it difficult to communicate the right information in the right place. Insights from one project can be relevant to other subprojects, and some information spans multiple subprojects.
- There should be multiple ways to consume docs, through multiple points of delivery.

## Processes

Notes about our official processes are captured here to help guide Docs Working Group members in their efforts.

### Moots

Moots are a type of event/meeting hosted by member(s) of the Docs Working Group. In short, they're group-wide meetings that seek to bring experts and Docs Working Group members together so that expert information, opinions, and other materials can be gathered on a specific topic/area for the purpose of writing documentation (or otherwise furthering the Docs Working Group's mission).

To hold a moot, we need to announce it to the Docs Working Group members, so make an issue or come to the weekly meetings and state your desire for a moot. If consensus has been reached about the need for a moot, planning can begin. Moots are gatherings for experts and Docs Working Group members, so we also need to identify and invite/schedule the relevant experts to come to the moot (members can and should help with this where possible).

During the moot, we should attempt to record the meeting for use as a record to refer to during creation of subsequent documentation/materials. We should also try to organize concepts and create notes that capture relevant information, in collaboration with and review by our experts (to ensure accuracy).
